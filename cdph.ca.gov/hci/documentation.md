Caveats
=======

In the ``Neighborhood Change`` files, the Relative Standard Error (rse)
column is often computed for values that are ver close to zero, so the 
RSE is very large. In other files in this dataset, the rse value is capped
at 100, so values in the Neighborhood Change file is also capped at 100.
