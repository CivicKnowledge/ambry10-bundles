From the [FAQ](http://askchisne.ucla.edu/ask/_layouts/ne/dashboard.aspx#/help):

"The population estimates in AskCHIS NE represent the CHIS 2011-2012 population sample, which excludes Californians living in group quarters (such as prisons, nursing homes, and dormitories). The population estimates are generated based on Nielsen-Claritas Popfacts (demographic projection), non-group quarter proportions from Census 2010 at the Census tract level, and CHIS control totals (based on the California Department of Finance). CHIS uses a weighting methodology that forces CHIS estimates to be consistent with official population estimates at county-level from California Department of Finance. These benchmark population estimates are called population control totals. Further information on the CHIS control totals is available in the CHIS 2011-2012 Methods Report #5. Due to differences in the target population as well as in data sources for control totals, our population estimates may differ from other sources."
