    summary: HDI is a model cumulative index of community health disadvantage. It
        was developed by statewide public health department data experts by adapting
        international best practices and integrating 27 economic, social, environmental,
        and health data indicators. Sample HDI indicators include economic security,
        educational and employment opportunity, civic engagement, neighborhood quality,
        and premature mortality. Indicators are weighted based on their impact on
        human health, development and well-being.
