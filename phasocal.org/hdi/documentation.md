The [Public Health Alliance](http://phasocal.org/) has developed a composite index to identify cumulative health disadvantage in California. The purpose of this Health Disadvantage Index (HDI) is to prioritize public and private investments, resources and programs. HDI includes diverse non-medical economic, social, political and environmental factors that influence physical and cognitive function, behavior and disease. These factors are often called health determinants or social determinants of health and form the root causes of disadvantage. Indicator data used for HDI comes from publicly available sources and is produced at a census tract level. HDI materials are freely available online for use by communities and public and private agencies.
