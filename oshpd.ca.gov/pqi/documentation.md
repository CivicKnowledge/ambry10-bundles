The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has developed four types of Quality Indicators (QIs), measures of healthcare quality, that make use of hospital inpatient discharge data.

Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) identify hospital admissions (age 18 and over) that evidence suggests may have been avoided through access to high-quality outpatient care. The PQIs are also called "ambulatory care-sensitive conditions" or "preventable hospitalizations." These measures assess the quality of the healthcare system as a whole, especially ambulatory care, in preventing hospitalizations due to potentially-avoidable medical complications.

Area-Level (Statewide, County) hospitalization rates are provided for the following PQI measures:

- PQI #1 Diabetes Short-term Complications
- PQI #2 Perforated Appendix (ruptured appendix)
- PQI #3 Diabetes Long-term Complications
- PQI #5 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or Asthma in Older Adults (ages 40 and over)
- PQI #7 Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- PQI #8 Heart Failure
- PQI #10 Dehydration
- PQI #11 Bacterial Pneumonia
- PQI #12 Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
- PQI #13 Angina Without Procedure (chest pain)
- PQI #14 Uncontrolled Diabetes
- PQI #15 Asthma in Younger Adults (ages 18-39)
- PQI #16 Lower-Extremity Amputation among Patients with Diabetes (removal of leg or foot due to diabetes complications)
- PQI #90 Prevention Quality Overall Composite (includes PQIs #1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16)
- PQI #91 Prevention Quality Acute Composite (includes PQIs #10, 11, and 12)
- PQI #92 Prevention Quality Chronic Composite (includes PQIs #1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, and 16)
OSHPD views the area-level indicators as useful starting points for examining healthcare quality, but does not regard them as definitive measures of quality.
