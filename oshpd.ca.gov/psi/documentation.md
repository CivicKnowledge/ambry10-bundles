The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has developed four types of Quality Indicators (QIs), measures of healthcare quality, that make use of hospital inpatient discharge data.

Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) are measures that represent rates of potentially-preventable adverse events that occur during a hospital stay. They provide a perspective on potential complications and errors resulting from a hospital admission and help assess total incidence within a region.

Area-Level (Statewide, County) hospitalization rates are provided for the following PSI measures:

- PSI #21 Retained Surgical Item or Unretrieved Device Fragment
- PSI #22 Iatrogenic Pneumothorax
- PSI #23 Central Venous Catheter-Related Blood Stream Infection
- PSI #24 Postoperative Wound Dehiscence
- PSI #25 Accidental Puncture or Laceration
- PSI #26 Transfusion Reaction
- PSI #27 Perioperative Hemorrhage or Hematoma

OSHPD views the area-level indicators as useful starting points for examining healthcare quality, but does not regard them as definitive measures of quality.
