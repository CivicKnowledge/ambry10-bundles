  summary: This dataset provides a simple cross walk using Office of Statewide Health
    Planning and Development (OSHPD) assigned licensed facility identification numbers
    linked with matched California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Licensing and
    Certification facility lists based on license number.  This is not a comprehensive
    matched list, facility identification numbers that did not match are also included
    from both the OSHPD and CDPH lists.  Facility Status or Facility Level designations
    may explain some OSHPD non-matches, for additional information contact OSHPD directly.  Please
    contact CDPH directly for more information regarding un-matched facility identifiers
    that do not have corresponding OSHPD identifiers.
