  summary: Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) use indicators from other AHRQ QI modules
    with adaptations for use among children. Similar to Prevention Quality Indicators,
    the PDIs identify hospital admissions that evidence suggests may have been avoided
    through access to high-quality outpatient care.
