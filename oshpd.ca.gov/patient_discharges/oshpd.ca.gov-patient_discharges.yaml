    summary: The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD)
        provides public data sets of patient discharge (PDD), emergency department
        (ED), and ambulatory surgery (AS) data collected from licensed California
        hospitals, hospital emergency departments, and licensed freestanding ambulatory
        surgery clinics in California. Each record within the data sets consists of
        either one inpatient discharge, or one outpatient encounter, also known as
        a service visit. Data included on the public data sets includes clinical,
        payer, and facility information.

-   column: mdc
    description: Major Diagnostic Category (MDC). MDC code (for example, 22). The
        Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) are formed by dividing all possible principal
        diagnoses (from ICD-9) into 25 mutually exclusive diagnosis groupings. The
        diagnoses in each MDC correspond to a single organ system or etiology and,
        in general, are associated with a particular medical specialty. MDC 1 to MDC
        23 are grouped according to principal diagnosis. Patients are assigned to
        MDC 24 (Multiple Significant Trauma) with at least two significant trauma
        diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondary) from different body site
        categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have a principal
        diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV
        related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection. Some discharges
        are associated with procedures that are resource intensive and may be associated
        with multiple diagnosis domains (for example, transplants, MS-DRG 001-017),
        or procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis (MS-DRG 981-989).
        These records are assigned to a variety of MDCs, based on the principal diagnosis
        instead of the MDC associated with the designated DRG. A MDC of 00 is assigned
        to records that are ungroupable. Ungroupable records include those where the
        principal diagnosis is not an existing ICD-9-CM code or the sex code does
        not logically relate to the diagnosis or procedure. For a list of MDC codes
        and labels see Appendix I - Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). Note that MDC
        codes and their associated labels potentially change across years and year-specific
        code-label crosswalk lists must be used.

        admission are reported. Procedures are coded according to the ICD-9-CM.

        Charges include, but are not limited to, daily hospital services, ancillary
        services and any patient care services. Hospital-based physician fees are
        excluded. Prepayments (e.g., deposits and prepaid admissions) are not deducted
        from Total Charges.

        Total charges are reported in whole numbers and are rounded to the nearest
        thousand dollars ($1000). A zero amount is shown when the charges were less
        than $499.99, when there were no charges, when the charge is unknown, or when
        an invalid value is reported. Facilities with approved modifications to not
        report Total Charges are listed in Appendix C  Modifications and Exceptions.
        Total Charges of $9,999,999 indicates the actual charges exceed the maximum
        seven digit input field size. When a patient''s length of stay is more than
        1 year (365 days), only the last 365 days of charges are reported. Use the
        following formula to adjust total charges to reflect stays more than 1 year
        in length:

        Adjusted Total Charges = (Total Charges / 365 days) x Length of Stay

    description: Major Diagnostic Category (MDC). MDC code (for example, 22). The
        Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) are formed by dividing all possible principal
        diagnoses (from ICD-9) into 25 mutually exclusive diagnosis groupings. The
        diagnoses in each MDC correspond to a single organ system or etiology and,
        in general, are associated with a particular medical specialty. MDC 1 to MDC
        23 are grouped according to principal diagnosis. Patients are assigned to
        MDC 24 (Multiple Significant Trauma) with at least two significant trauma
        diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondary) from different body site
        categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have a principal
        diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV
        related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection. Some discharges
        are associated with procedures that are resource intensive and may be associated
        with multiple diagnosis domains (for example, transplants, MS-DRG 001-017),
        or procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis (MS-DRG 981-989).
        These records are assigned to a variety of MDCs, based on the principal diagnosis
        instead of the MDC associated with the designated DRG. A MDC of 00 is assigned
        to records that are ungroupable. Ungroupable records include those where the
        principal diagnosis is not an existing ICD-9-CM code or the sex code does
        not logically relate to the diagnosis or procedure. For a list of MDC codes
        and labels see Appendix I - Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). Note that MDC
        codes and their associated labels potentially change across years and year-specific
        code-label crosswalk lists must be used.

        Charges include, but are not limited to, daily hospital services, ancillary
        services and any patient care services. Hospital-based physician fees are
        excluded. Prepayments (e.g., deposits and prepaid admissions) are not deducted
        from Total Charges.

        Total charges are reported in whole numbers and are rounded to the nearest
        thousand dollars ($1000). A zero amount is shown when the charges were less
        than $499.99, when there were no charges, when the charge is unknown, or when
        an invalid value is reported. Facilities with approved modifications to not
        report Total Charges are listed in Appendix C  Modifications and Exceptions.
        Total Charges of $9,999,999 indicates the actual charges exceed the maximum
        seven digit input field size. When a patient''s length of stay is more than
        1 year (365 days), only the last 365 days of charges are reported. Use the
        following formula to adjust total charges to reflect stays more than 1 year
        in length:

        Adjusted Total Charges = (Total Charges / 365 days) x Length of Stay
