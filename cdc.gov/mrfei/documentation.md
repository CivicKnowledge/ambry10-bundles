# Modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI)


From the primary documentation:

The modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI) is a way of measuring the number of healthy and less healthy food retailers in an area using a single number. Out of the total number of food retailers in that area considered either healthy or less healthy, the mRFEI represents the percentage that are healthy. Therefore, lower scores indicate that census tracts contain many convenience stores and or fast food restaurants compared to the number of healthy food retailers. A zero score indicates that no healthy food retailers (supermarkets, large grocery stores, produce stores or supercenters) are located in the census tract.

When the mRFEI was calculated, the distribution of more than 1 million supermarkets, produce stores, supercenters, fast food restaurants, and convenience stores located throughout the country was examined. An mRFEI score of 10 means that only 10 out of every 100 of these stores were likely to offer healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy items, meat products, and whole grain foods. These include the supermarkets, produce stores, and supercenters. The other 90 stores were unlikely provide access to healthy foods. These include convenience stores, small grocery stores, and fast food restaurants.
